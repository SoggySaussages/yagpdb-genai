# Generative AI Plugin for YAGPDB

This is a plugin for [YAGPDB](https://github.com/botlabs-gg/yagpdb) which enables Generative AI features:

- Using the `genai` command
- Creating your own commands with preset prompts (easier than custom commands!)
- Moderating messages in Advanced Automoderator
- Using the `genaiComplete`, `genaiCompleteComplex`, and `genaiModerate` functions in Custom Commands

The Generative AI provider and model is configurable per-server, or globally with env settings.
